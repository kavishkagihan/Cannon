Cannon is a cross-platform post-exploitation framework fully developed in python3. Once you have access to the system, this will make your work much easier with all the functionalities that this tool possesses. You will be able to download and upload files, run pre-defined modules, harvest reverse shells, and many more. This version of Cannon mainly focuses on attacking Unix-based machines. Most of the utilities that this framework carries based on Unix-based systems. But some of the functions will still work in Windows systems as well.
